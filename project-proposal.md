# Space 

## Overview
    Our project will create an educational app about space for children.  It will contain a parental log in, multiples games targeted for different age ranges, 
    definitions of different space terms.  The score of the games will be saved under the user information.
    The home page will include a "pic of the day" from the NASA API.
